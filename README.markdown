Tips
----

1.  Run `brew install mit-scheme` on OS X.

2.  Be sure to have some housework left to do while MIT Scheme is
    installing (cleaning windows and washing carpets takes about
    enough time).

3.  Use `mit-scheme --quiet < code.scm` before you change the way you
    think and write code.

4.  Don't download bigger videos -- they're not better, just bigger.
